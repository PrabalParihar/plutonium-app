> everything you need to build on Solana! 🚀

🧪 Plutonium Network is a decentralized streaming payments protocol build on Solana.It's a powerful concept that serves as a building block for various payment-related solutions. Currently this type of platform is not build on Solana.

A streaming payment represents a progressively released payment, that allows users to link their tokens with yield earning strategies which earns yield on the deposited token waiting to be streamed. The yield can be distributed in the custom ratio to the stream creator and stream receiver.

🎛 Features of Plutonium Network on Solana-

##Ultra low-risk trial period
Stream is initialized for the trial period and can be stopped by the initiator (employer) at any moment if a 
decision to stop working with the employee/contractor is made.
Stream beneficiary (employee/contractor) receives what has been “streamed” up until that moment, and 
the rest of the amount is returned back to the employer.

##Improved payroll
Employees can withdraw their earned salary more frequently.Continuous streams provide a modern alternative to the traditional payroll system where salaries are paid once a month. This solution can also serve as an escrow service when trust isn't yet established between the parties.
Employers get a simple, straightforward, and cost-effective payroll solution that’s also a powerful tool for 
recruiting and retention, while earning attractive interest on the deposited funds.

##Services billed per time unit
Pay per usage. Consulting, live events & concerts, audio/video content, bike renting or even parking.Deposit the funds and stop the stream once the service ends. 

##Vesting contracts
Vesting is a perfect application of a stream. You can set the custom rate and release/unlock date(s). This is what we'll be focusing on next.
